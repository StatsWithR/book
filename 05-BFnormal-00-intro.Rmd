# Hypothesis Testing with Normal Populations

In Section \@ref(sec:bayes-factors), we described how the Bayes factors can be used for hypothesis testing. Now we will use the Bayes factors to compare normal means, i.e., test whether the mean of a population is zero or compare the means of two groups of normally-distributed populations. We divide this mission into three cases: known variance for a single population, unknown variance for a single population using paired data, and unknown variance using two independent groups.

Also note that some of the examples in this section use an updated version of the `bayes_inference` function. 
If your local output is different from what is seen in this chapter, or the provided code fails to run for you please make sure that you have the most recent version of the package.
