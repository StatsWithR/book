[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/e5fbd87dd2da27deb4415512c831ff1f/m/master "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/byKey/e5fbd87dd2da27deb4415512c831ff1f)

This book is a written companion for the Course 'Bayesian Statistics' from the Statistics with R specialization available on Coursera, but may be used on its own as an open-access introduction to Bayesian inference using R. Materials and examples from the course are discussed more extensively and extra examples and exercises are provided. 

At this time, you will need to install `statsr` from GitHub using the BayesFactor branch"
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("StatsWithR/statsr", ref="BayesFactor")
```
as well as download `BAS` with a version >= 1.4.8
from `CRAN`. 

Please note that the book and the BayesFactor branch are for supporting the next release of the course.  If you are currently enrolled in the Coursera course, please use caution in updating as some functions have been deprecated.
