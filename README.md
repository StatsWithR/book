This book is a written companion for the Course *Bayesian Statistics* from the  [*Statistics with `R`*](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)  specialization available on Coursera, but may be used on its own as an open-access introduction to Bayesian inference using `R`.  Materials and examples from the course are discussed more extensively and extra examples and exercises are provided.  There are optional sections for those interested in understanding some of the derivations behind Bayesian statistics. 

To run any of the examples in the book or access data sets used in the book, please install the current versions of `statsr` and `BAS` from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org).

```
install.packages('statsr', dep=T)
install.packages('BAS', dep=T)
```



Please note that the book and `statsr` package on CRAN are for supporting the next release of the course.  If you are currently enrolled in the Coursera course, please use caution in updating as some functions have been deprecated or modified.
